# Ollie – A Financial Assistant for Students & First-Time Earners 💸

Ollie is an AI-friendly financial assistant built to help students and first-time earners build sustainable financial habits.
It’s a **personal project** with real-world ambitions — evolving from a learning tool into a fully-fledged web app for mobile and desktop users.

Currently in active development using **FastAPI**, **SQLite**, and **modular Python**, Ollie will later integrate AI-powered budgeting insights, visual dashboards, and mobile deployment.



## 📌 Why I’m Building This

I’m a **student** and aspiring AI engineer who wants to build something useful, technically challenging, and user-focused. 
Ollie started as a learning project, but I’m committed to making it real for people like me who didn’t grow up with financial literacy or the right tools.

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Problem**: Most students and early earners struggle to manage their finances with existing apps that are too complex, too corporate, or not personalized.

**Solution**: Ollie offers a simple, educational, and supportive financial experience — starting with core expense tracking and growing into AI-powered, behavior-based financial coaching.
